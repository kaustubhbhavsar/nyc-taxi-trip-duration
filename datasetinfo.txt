The dataset utilized for this project is obtained by downloading it from the NYC Taxi Trip Duration 
competition on Kaggle.

Throughout the entire project, solely the training dataset is utilized.

The training dataset comprises 1458644 records, encompassing data from the period between January 
and June in the year 2016.

The evaluation of the model is carried out through Cross-Validation, employing TimeSeriesSplits 
as well. In order to accomplish this, data from January to May is utilized for the Cross-Validation 
process, while the data from June is reserved solely for testing the final model.

NOTE:
To maintain clarity, the data utilized in production incorporates current data timestamps, 
which may not be ideal, but it serves as a simple and valuable approach for experimentation purposes.
